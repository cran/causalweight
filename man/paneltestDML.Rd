\arguments{

\item{y0}{Potential outcomes for the non-treated.}

\item{d}{Treatment group indicator (binary). Should not contain missing values.}

\item{x}{Covariates to be controlled for. Should not contain missing values.}

\item{trim}{Trimming threshold for discarding observations with too small propensity scores within any subgroup defined by the treatment group and time. Default is 0.05.}

\description{
This function applies an overidentification test to assess if unconfoundedness of the treatments and conditional common trends as imposed in differences-in-differences jointly hold in panel data when evaluating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATET).
}
\details{
The test statistic corresponds to the difference between the ATETs that are based on two distinct doubly robust score functions, namely that under unconfoundedness and that based on difference-in-differences under conditional common trends. Estimation in panel data is based on double machine learning and the function supports different machine learning methods to estimate nuisance parameters (conditional mean outcomes and propensity scores) as well as cross-fitting to mitigate overfitting.
ATETselobs and ATETdid equals zero.
